Have you ever come across a website where the images or elements start animating as you scroll or when they intersect with other elements on the page? If yes, then you've experienced the power of animating on scroll or intersect!

Animating on scroll or intersect is a technique used by web developers to create dynamic and engaging user experiences. It involves using JavaScript to detect when an element enters or exits the user's view and triggering an animation or transition based on that event.

One way to achieve this is by using the JavaScript Intersection Observer API, which allows you to monitor changes in the intersection of a target element with its parent container or viewport. By using the Intersection Observer API, you can trigger animations when an element becomes visible in the viewport, or when it intersects with other elements on the page.

Animating on scroll/intersect is not limited to a specific framework or library. You can use this technique with any JavaScript library or framework, including React, Vue, and Native. In this blog, we'll cover how to implement this technique using the Intersection Observer API with React, Vue, and Native.

So, whether you're a front-end developer looking to add some pizzazz to your website, or you're just curious about the inner workings of web development, read on to learn how to animate on scroll/intersect with JavaScript!
